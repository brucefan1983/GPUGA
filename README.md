# `GPUGA`
Graphics Processing Units Genetic Algorithm

## What is `GPUGA`?
* `GPUGA` stands for Graphics Processing Units Genetic Algorithm. It is a code for empirical potential fitting using the genetic algorithm (GA).
* Using my laptop with a GeForce RTX 2070 GPU card, fitting an empirical potential using `GPUGA` only takes **about one minute**!

## Prerequisites
* You need to have a GPU card with compute capability no less than 3.5 and a `CUDA` toolkit which supports your GPU card installed.
* I have only tested the code in linux operating system.

## Compile GPUGA
* Go to the `src` directory and type `make`. When the compilation finishes, an executable named `gpuga` will be generated in the `src` directory. 

## Run GPUGA
* To run the provided example, go to the directory where you can see `src` and type `src/gpuga < examples/input.txt`
* The example corresponds to the case study for diamond silicon in the preprint below.
